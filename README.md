# Bamazon

## What is Bamazon?
Bamazon is a Node & MySQL application that acts like a simplistic version of Amazon. A user can purchase an item or multiple items, if in stock, from the "store." The user will be asked what product they want and how much. Then, the user will be shown a confirmation of how much of the item they purchased and the cost. The store database will then be updated to reflect the purchase. 

## Why is Bamazon useful?
This project allowed the developer to apply her knowledge of mySQL, Node and its various packages, as well as scoping and creating different kinds of functions from installed packages.

## How can users get started with Bamazon?
Without my local server, this project will be difficult to work with right away. However, once a mySQL database is made and connected, the user should be able to run the files and inquirer will ask the questions -- just answer them!
